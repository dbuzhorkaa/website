      <p class="case-studies__paragraph not-apply">
        The customer, a Health Insurance company, was using Netezza to aggregate and report on multiple dimensions on
        different health care and services. They were looking for alternatives to offload the data from Netezza to
        reduce the workload for reducing the cost. Data Administrators, Data Analysts, Data Scientist and Engineers were
        operating and supporting the loading, cleansing and reporting efforts. They were facing a lot of difficulties in
        the following areas that was hindering their transition into Hadoop:
      </p>
      <ul class="case-studies__list">
        <li> Current implementation of moving data into and out of Hadoop was error prone and took a lot of effort and
          time to add new aggregations or reports
        </li>
        <li> Data Administrator, Data Analyst and Data Engineers were spending a lot of building complex workflows and
          less time on looking at data insights and reports
        </li>
        <li> Current implementation of moving data into and out of Hadoop was error prone and took a lot of effort and
          time to add new aggregations or reports
        </li>
        <li>
          Due to the health industry regulations, they were not having a reliable solution to track the flow of data in
          and out of cluster
        </li>
        <li>
          Integrating and making the data available within Impala was challenging
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="case-studies__title">CDAP value proposition(s)</h2>
      <p class="case-studies__paragraph not-apply">
        Customer was successfully able to extract data from Netezza and other SQL sources, perform complex joins,
        transformation and load it into distributed file system. They were then able to perform different aggregations
        and joins to generate the final reports. They were able to load the final report data back into Netezza
        seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p class="case-studies__paragraph not-apply">
        The companyâ€™s in-house team of Data Analysts, Data Scientists and Data Engineers built a data pipeline in less
        than a week using the drag-and-drop visual interface in CDAP.
      </p>
      <p class="case-studies__paragraph not-apply">
        They were then able to operationalize (schedule to run on a daily basis) and report on errors in data giving
        them the visibility that they were looking for.
        Beyond those capabilities, they were able to build pipeline level dashboard that provided them deep insights
        into how the offloading and report generation process was functioning.
